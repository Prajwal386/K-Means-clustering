# Project Title: K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset

This project aims to find the ideal number of clusters in Iris Dataset.

It uses the unsupervised learning algorithm K-means clustering through elbow method to find the ideal clusters  having the least within sum of the square(WCSS).
The Wcss was found out to be 78.94 having the ideal number of clusters as 3.
